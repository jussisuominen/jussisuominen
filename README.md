- I started to learn coding when I was about 12 years old. Coding has been my hobby since then and I have learned many programming languages and coding concepts throughout the years. Some of the programming languages I have learned are (Q)Basic, C/C++, Javascript, Java, PHP, Python, C#, Ruby and Assembly. I have also learned how to create and style websites with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and W3CSS. In addition I have learned how to create web apps with Javascript, Vue and React.
