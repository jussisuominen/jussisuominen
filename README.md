Hi, my name is Jussi Suominen and I'm 37 years old. I'm currently learning information technology and software development in Winnova Pori. I also study some courses in Udemy and I'm mainly concentrating on studying the course Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide [2023 Edition] (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/).

I’m currently interested in web and (mobile) app development (Front End, Back End, Full stack, web/mobile apps, creating/designing/styling websites/mobile apps etc.), coding and software development in general and almost everything related to computers, electronics and technology in general.

I’m looking to collaborate on creating web apps/sites, mobile apps, blogs, and apps in general.

I started to learn coding when I was about 12 years old. Coding has been my hobby since then and I have learned many programming languages and coding concepts throughout the years. Some of the programming languages I have learned are (Q)Basic, C/C++, Javascript, Java, PHP, Python, C#, Ruby and Assembly. I have also learned how to create and style websites with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and W3CSS. In addition I have learned how to create web apps with Javascript, Vue and React. I have learned how to make websites/apps with Django, Flask and ExpressJS.

You can reach me by sending me email to jussuom@gmail.com
